1) Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
   
The objective of the gaming room project is to create a cross-platform web-based game inspired by the existing "Draw It or Lose It" game, originally exclusive to Android. In this game, the goal is to form multiple teams, each composed of several players, and engage in four one-minute rounds. During each round, a random image is selected from a library of pictures. One team takes turns guessing the image, with a time limit for their guesses. If they fail to guess correctly within the allotted time, members of opposing teams can take a shot at answering within 15 seconds.

2) What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Something I feel I did particularly well was the evaluation. Everytime I came back to rework the assignment I found something new to edit or add on.

3) What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through a design document helped me when developing the my code becuase it helped me lay out what needed to be done in my head instead of blindly coding.

4) If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would choose the recommendation section because I feel I could've added more information within my responses.

5) How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user’s needs and implemented them into my software design by working my code around their requests. It is so important to consider the user’s needs when designing so you don't write unneccesary code or make the client unhappy.

6) How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approachwd designing my software by encorporating a design document to organize my thoughts. I would use this technique again in future projects.
